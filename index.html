      <h2>About the Kingdom</h2>
      <p>
        Colchis is known in Greek mythology as the destination of the Argonauts,
        as well as the home to Medea and the Golden Fleece.It was also described
        as a land rich with gold, iron, timber and honey that would export its
        resources mostly to ancient Hellenic city-states. Colchis is generally
        believed to have been populated by early Kartvelian-speaking tribes
        ancestral to the contemporary western Georgians, namely Svans and Zans.
        According to David Marshall Lang: "one of the most important elements in
        the modern Georgian nation, the Colchians were probably established in
        the Caucasus by the Middle Bronze Age. Colchis likely had a diverse
        population. According to Greek and Roman sources, between 70 and 300
        languages were spoken in Dioscourias (modern Sukhumi) alone. According
        to Rayfield, the first mention of Colchis is during the reign of the
        Assyrian king Tukulti-Ninurta I (1245–1209 BC) when he mentions "40
        kings by the Upper[Black] Sea". Abkhaz, Scythian, Anatolian, and Greek
        names have all been identified in Colchis. Any of these groups could
        have constituted the ruling class. Its geography is mostly assigned to
        what is now the western part of Georgia and encompasses the present-day
        Georgian provinces of Samegrelo, Imereti, Guria, Adjara, Abkhazia,
        Svaneti, Racha; modern Russia's Sochi and Tuapse districts; and
        present-day Turkey’s Artvin, Rize, and Trabzon provinces.
